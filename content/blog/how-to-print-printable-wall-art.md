In this blog post, we tell you everything there is to know about printing your wall art. Some topics covered include printing sizes, printing services, printing at home and much more. Wondering how to frame your wall art?, we have a section on this also.

## What is printable wall art?
Printable wall art is simply wall art you can print yourself, or get a printing service to print and frame it for you. You purchase a design, download it to your computer, then get it printed and framed.





## What are the diffrent types of files printable wall art comes in?
Printable wall art is offered in many different types of files. We offer JPEG, PDF and PNG, which covers all possible scenarios and printing methods. All the files we offer can be opened on any computer, phone, notebook, iPad of any make or model. We offer extremely high DPI (dots per inch, for printing) which allows super quality printing at large poster size. There is nothing worse than printing a file, and it turns out fuzzy, this will not happen with our files. 

## How do I open the wall art files?
You can open our wall art files on any device, new or old, it does not matter. 

## How do I print the wall art files?
If you decide to print the wall art files at home, you will probably have a printer that can print up to A4. This means you may not be able to print them in very large sizes, as most home printers don't print larger than A4 or A3. In this case, you can simply get them printed at any printing service that offers large sizes. If you google (photo printing services near me) you will find a list of printing services. You will be able to drop in your files if they ask, or you can upload your files to their website, pick the size you want printed, then order it.

## What type of paper should I use for home printing?
If you decide to print at home, you can purchase (matte) paper, which does not look shiny, or (glossy) paper, and it will look shiny, like a photo.
